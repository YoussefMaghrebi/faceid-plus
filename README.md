# üß† FaceID+: Face Recognition with Liveness Detection and Vector Search

A minimal yet complete facial recognition system built with **ArcFace**, **FAISS**, **FastAPI**, and **liveness detection**. Designed to demonstrate core facial biometrics functionalities expected in real-world deployments (authentication, anti-spoofing, vector search), this project showcases how to build and deploy a functional system using production-relevant tools.

## üîç Building FAISS Index

To build the vector index used for face identification, run the following script `build_index.py` found in `scripts/`, from the root directory of the project:

```bash
python build_index.py
```

This script performs the following:

* Loads cropped and aligned face images from the `data/employee_faces/` directory.
* Embeds each image using a pre-trained ArcFace model.
* Normalizes and adds the embeddings to a FAISS index (using cosine similarity).
* Saves the index (`face_index.faiss`) and the corresponding identity labels (`face_labels.pkl`) for later search.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Note:** The employee face images should be organized in subfolders under `data/employee_faces/`, where each subfolder is named after the identity and contains multiple face images of that person. A notebook detailing this process is found in `notebooks/image_db_creation.ipynb`.

### üìå PS:
We used the ArcFace ResNet100 ONNX model hosted on **Hugging Face** by **FoivosPar/Arc2Face**, found in the link (https://huggingface.co/FoivosPar/Arc2Face/blob/da2f1e9aa3954dad093213acfc9ae75a68da6ffd/arcface.onnx), since the original `"arcface_r100_v1"` is no longer hosted by InsightFace.
This embedding model is compatible with the ArcFace model integrated into the InsightFace `"buffalo_l"` pack and was selected for standalone embedding of already-aligned and cropped faces that don't need to undergo the detection phase.

## Known Issues

* Attempting to install `faiss-gpu` via `pip` is not supported, and downloading it with `conda` may lead to difficult runtime conflicts due to OpenMP (`libiomp5md.dll`) initialization errors when used alongside other GPU libraries like `onnxruntime-gpu`.
* For more details on this issue and the current workaround, please see the **Dependency Choice & the FAISS-GPU Dilemma** section in the project report.

## üîí Notes on Security

Embeddings are stored locally using FAISS with added AES encryption.

The API can be extended with HTTPS, JWT, and role-based access control.
